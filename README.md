# XBMC-Kai
An attempt to integrate [xLink Kai](https://www.teamxlink.co.uk/) back into XBMC4Xbox and derratives

### How it works
XBMC-Kai makes use of Kai Engine's Simple HTTP Api (Thanks CrunchBite!!) to comunitcate to the engine. You can take a look at an idea of how it can be like [here](./Flowchart.md)

### Why are you doing this?
Hopes are to have something **similar** to the old Kai integration in [XBMC Build rev14095](http://149.56.47.64/xbox/XBMC-SVN_2008-07-15_rev14095-T3CH-FIXED.rar)
At the very least set the Arena and connect once a game starts. 


### Why not use the older build?
Well, cause it's older. A lot of things aren't supporting it, and most new users will probably use 3.5.3, XBMC4Gamers or XBMC-Emustation
If anything, this might give the ability to newer users to connect with similar ease, and hopefully just as seamless.
_Although_ if you want to integrate the old stuff into the newer versions, feel free! The source for it right [here](https://svn.exotica.org.uk:8443/xbmc4xbox/branches/old_releases/2.1a1-candidate/)

### Python help requested.
Python is **not** my first language, nor is it the style I am accustomed to. You might cringe at some bits, but in all honesty, any help is deeply appreciated.
